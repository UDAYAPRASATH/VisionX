I already have a fully working backend codebase for my AI-powered visual testing tool, built using Playwright and TypeScript. It performs screenshot capture, baseline comparison, diff calculation using pixelmatch, and returns test result JSON with failure metadata. I want to build a world-class, premium-level UI for this product named â€˜VisionXâ€™.

ðŸ’¡ This UI must be:

Pixel-perfect, responsive, and elegant

Built using Next.js + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI

Enhanced with Framer Motion for micro-interactions and animations

Developer-friendly, intuitive, and as polished as tools like Vercel, Linear, or Applitools

ðŸ§  Key Instruction (Important):

âœ… You must merge and integrate the existing backend logic (test result JSONs, screenshots folder structure, image diff logic) into this new UI without any failure or loss of functionality.
âœ… The UI must consume real test result data and reflect actual pass/fail outcomes â€” no dummy placeholders or broken flow.
âœ… Do not mock backend responses â€” the system should work with real screenshot folders like /baseline, /actual, /diff and test result files.

ðŸ§© Core UI Pages Required:

VisionX Dashboard â€“ Test summary, trend graph, failed count, heatmaps

Test Runs Viewer â€“ List of all runs with filters, screenshot previews, and status indicators

Visual Diff Page â€“ Real screenshot comparison using side-by-side, slider, or overlay view

AI Insight Panel â€“ Displays auto-generated visual issues like "Button shifted" or "Text cropped"

Acceptance Panel â€“ Users can accept/reject changes and update baselines

Report Generator â€“ Create and share test run summary PDFs or public links

Settings & Roles â€“ Theme switcher, API key manager, user roles

ðŸš€ Deployment & Integration:

UI must be production-ready and easily deployed to Vercel or Netlify

Should support loading images and JSON results from a local or remote backend

All UI actions must reflect actual state changes from backend (e.g., accepting a failed diff should trigger baseline update)

CI/CD ready for integration with Playwright test automation pipelines

ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal: Build VisionX as a high-end, AI-powered visual testing UI that merges beautifully with my working backend, delivers a stunning user experience, and feels enterprise-level outÂ ofÂ theÂ box."
